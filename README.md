# aps-abs

LaTeX template for American Physical Society meeting abstracts

The original author is Scott Beckman spbeckman@gmail.com in 2008, but I got it second-hand some time ago.  It seems to still be valid.  I'm adding it to GitHub so that others may easily find it.

There was no license included with the original file.

## Instructions
*From the source file*

Note that the actual abstract submission process must now be done
by filling out a web form at
 
> http://abstracts.aps.org/
 
However, it is recommended to prepare your abstract using this
template, so that all co-authors can agree on all the details.
Then, when the time comes to submit the abstract, you will have
just have to cut and paste the information from this abstract
into the APS web page.
 
Note that it is permissible to use latex constructs in author,
title, and abstract entries when filling the web form.

For pointers about the process of submitting the abstract to the
APS web site, see http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/aps_abstracts/ .

To use this file you need the APS abstract style file apsab.sty, 
which should be available with this example file.  

Complete the below information and run LaTeX.  

The abstract block will be produced inside of a red box.  If the 
abstract exceeds the red box then you will need to shorten the 
abstract. Of course this is a rough guide and if you're within
plus or minus one line of the bottom boarder it is best to check 
the length using the official APS submission process.  

This form was created in 2008 when the abstract limit was 1300 
character.
